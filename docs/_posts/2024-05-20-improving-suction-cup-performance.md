### **Improving Suction Cup Performance**
Every floor is unique. Try these tips to get the best possible seal:

- **Ensure the floor is clean and dry**: Dirt, dust, or moisture can reduce suction power. Wipe the area thoroughly before applying.
- **Apply firm pressure**: Press down on the Gap Tap to eliminate air pockets and activate the suction mechanism.
- **Use the included silicone pad**: For **grooved or textured floors with a glossy finish**, place the **glossy side of the silicone pad face-down** on the panel. Smooth out any air bubbles before applying the Gap Tap.
- **Use the included silicone grease**: For **matte or porous grooved floors**, apply a thin layer of **silicone grease** around the edge of the suction cup. This improves grip and helps form a tighter seal.
