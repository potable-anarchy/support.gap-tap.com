### **Safety First!**
Always wear safety glasses and gloves when using Gap Tap. Keep your fingers and other body parts clear of the striking area.
Use the tool only as directed to avoid damage to the flooring or injury.

1. **Prepare**
- Remove debris from the gap with a vacuum, toothpick, or other tool.
- Clean the panel with a microfiber cloth and let it dry.
- If you're working with a **grooved or textured floor**, lay down the included silicone pad between the Gap Tap and the floor to enhance the seal.
- For **matte or porous grooved floors**, apply a thin layer of silicone grease around the edge of the suction cup to create a stronger seal.

2. **Position**
- Place the suction cup on the floor panel closest to the wall, in-line with the gap.
- Press down and lock the suction cup firmly.

3. **TAP**
- Strike the designated area with a hammer or kick gently.
- Repeat until the gap is closed.
- Unlock and remove Gap Tap when done.
