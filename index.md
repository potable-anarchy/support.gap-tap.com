### **Safety First!**
Always wear safety glasses and gloves when using Gap Tap. Keep your fingers and other body parts clear of the striking area.
Use the tool only as directed to avoid damage to the flooring or injury.

1. **Prepare**
- Remove debris from the gap with a vacuum, toothpick, or other tool.
- Clean the panel with a microfiber cloth and let it dry.
- If you're working with a **grooved or textured floor**, lay down the included silicone pad between the Gap Tap and the floor to enhance the seal.
- For **matte or porous grooved floors**, apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly or silicone grease around the edge of the suction cup to create a stronger seal.
**Note:** Avoid using petroleum jelly and silicone grease with the included silicone pad.

2. **Position**
- Place the suction cup on the floor panel closest to the wall, in-line with the gap.
- Press down and lock the suction cup firmly.

3. **TAP**
- Strike the designated area with a hammer or kick gently.
- Repeat until the gap is closed.
- Unlock and remove Gap Tap when done.

### **Improving Suction Cup Performance**
To ensure the best seal, follow these tips:
- **Ensure the floor is clean**: Dirt, dust, or moisture can reduce adhesion. Wipe the area dry before applying.
- **Apply firm pressure**: Press down firmly when locking the Gap Tap to remove any trapped air.
- **Use the included silicone pad**: For **grooved or textured floors with a glossy finish**, place the silicone pad beneath the suction cup to enhance the seal.
- **Use petroleum jelly**: For **matte or porous grooved floors**, apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly or silicone grease around the edge of the suction cup to create a stronger seal.

### **What if Gap Tap isn’t sealing properly?**
Try these troubleshooting steps:
- **Clean and Dry the Surface**: Ensure both the suction cup and the floor are free of dust, dirt, or moisture. A dry surface improves suction.
- **Use the Silicone Pad**: For **textured or grooved surfaces with a glossy finish**, place the silicone pad underneath the suction cup to create a tighter seal.
- **Apply Firm Pressure**: Press down firmly to remove any trapped air before locking the suction cup into place.
- **Reposition if Needed**: Slight adjustments can help the suction cup find the optimal spot for a strong hold.
- **Use Petroleum Jelly**: For **matte or porous grooved floors**, apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly around the suction cup's edge. This creates an airtight seal for better grip.
