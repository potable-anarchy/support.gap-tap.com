### **How can I improve suction/adhesion?**
To ensure the best seal, follow these tips:
- **Use the included silicone pad**: If your floor has grooves or uneven surfaces, place the provided silicone pad beneath the cup to improve the seal.
- **Apply firm pressure**: Press down firmly when placing the Gap Tap to remove any trapped air.
- **Ensure the floor is clean**: Dirt, dust, or moisture can reduce adhesion. Wipe the area dry before applying.
- **Use on smooth surfaces**: Gap Tap works best on smooth, non-porous floors. If using on textured surfaces, the silicone pad helps enhance the seal.
