### **How can I improve suction/adhesion?**
To ensure the best seal, follow these tips:
- **Use the included silicone pad**: For **grooved or textured floors with a glossy finish**, place the silicone pad beneath the suction cup to enhance the seal.
- **Apply firm pressure**: Press down firmly when placing the Gap Tap to remove any trapped air.
- **Ensure the floor is clean**: Dirt, dust, or moisture can reduce adhesion. Wipe the area dry before applying.
- **Use petroleum jelly**: For **matte or porous grooved floors**, apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly or silicone grease around the edge of the suction cup to create a stronger seal.

### **What if Gap Tap isn’t sealing properly?**
Try these troubleshooting steps:
- **Clean and Dry the Surface**: Ensure both the suction cup and the floor are free of dust, dirt, or moisture. A dry surface improves suction.
- **Use the Silicone Pad**: For **textured or grooved surfaces with a glossy finish**, place the silicone pad underneath the suction cup to create a tighter seal.
- **Apply Firm Pressure**: Press down firmly to remove any trapped air before locking the suction cup into place.
- **Reposition if Needed**: Slight adjustments can help the suction cup find the optimal spot for a strong hold.
- **Use Petroleum Jelly**: For **matte or porous grooved floors**, apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly around the suction cup's edge. This creates an airtight seal for better grip.
